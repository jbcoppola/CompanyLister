InsitenCode is an Angular application to allow the user to create a list of companies in their web browser. The user can add companies via form, delete a company with a button, or edit a company's information.

There are two views, list and card view. They can be toggled with a button, as can the number of displayed companies on screen. The UI is fully responsive. Below a certain screen size the window is automatically forced to the mobile-friendly card view.

Users can search for a particular company by selecting a field and searching for either a string or selecting an option from a dropdown menu.
